Things we'll need
  # Zilla, import the font type, and font size, screen size, color schemes and the rest that we'll use. Integrate it into the tailwind config.

  # From now henceforth, our design is going to be following a structure

  # Create your own branch, and work on it

  # Create a pull request, so it can be reviewed before added to the master branch

  # Make your commit messages precise.
